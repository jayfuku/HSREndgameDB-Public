# What is HSREndgameDB?

[HSREndgameDB](https://hsr-endgame-db.vercel.app/) is a website designed to allow users to share clears of endgame content in the game "Honkai: Star Rail". Instead of trying to parse through Youtube searches or Reddit, you can now look through HSREndgameDB to find exactly what you want.

HSREndgameDB also preserves data of uploaded clears even after they're gone in the game to act as a sort of archive to get an idea of how the game evolves over time.

Furthermore, the site also places a big emphasis on clarity and usability across both mobile and desktop browser contexts to ensure that, no matter how you play HSR, information is a click away.

# Features

## Upload Clears

- Use the **Submit** tab in order to upload clears to site. The clear will be immediately shareable and viewable after you submit!

## View Clears

- Click on any clear in the homepage or follow any `hsr-endgame-db.vercel.app/details` link to go to a page where the uploader has provided more information.

## Search for Clears

- Utilize the filter system to find exactly what you are looking for.

# Future prospects

- More detailed posts
  - Relic stats
  - Luck factor rating (i.e. did this clear require a very specific sequence of events occuring?)
- Improved UI/UX
  - General UI touch-up
  - More soldified sitewide design language
- Improved filtering
  - Improved "search" functionality
  - Filter by characters
- Report and Flagging System
  - Report and flag off-topic posts
- Improved workflows for metadata updates

# Notes
- The search bar currently only works with exact searches due to computational limitations. I am currently exploring other options to improve this aspect of the site!
- HSREndgameDB is independently owned and operated and is not affiliated with MiHoYo, Hoyoverse, Cognosphere, or other entities related to the development, management, and/or distribution of Honkai: Star Rail.
